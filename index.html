    The fall in disposable income for families across the world resulting in throngs of families struggling to afford
    basic
    necessities of life such as energy, housing , food and beverages is what is termed as the Cost Of Living Crisis. A
    myriad of factors have their fair share of contributions to this predicament we find ourselves in.
    Some reasons include stagnant wages unable to keep up with rising prices and income disparity amongst sectors in
    society. Here, we zero in on the United Kingdom. Below is a visual depicting the median house price across regions of the UK. </h2>

        Here, we have a quick view of the average price of a house and the variance of energy costs over time across the UK. It is evident
        that London is the most expensive place to purchase a house with prices nearly double of those in other sectors of the United Kingdom.
        On the contrary, Scotland and Northern Ireland appeal to aspirant homeowners on a tight budget with prices less than 50% of the likes of London.
        However, energy bills across England, Wales and Scotland have seen a price rise of over 100% since 2017 which is cause for alarm. Even Ireland has seen a 68% rise.

Now let us find out how hard a Salaryman needs to work to purchase a new house. Below we show how overall house price changes over the years </h3>

<div class="paraclass" id="mychange">
  Here, we see that in 2017, the price of a house was about 130,000 GBP. Given that the hourly wage was about 12GBP at that time,you would
  require at least 10 years before you can purchase a house. However, given that annual salary growth is at around 2-5% on average,
  if your hourly wage is around 18 GBP by 2022, the price of a house was nearly 260,000 GBP. It would take at least 15-20 years to buy a house.

 Hence, compared to the average worker in the early 2000s, you currently need to work TWICE as hard to get a house.

  Let us now look at how Salary is distributed across regions of the United Kingdom and various age groups. Below is a lollipop chart
displaying the median hourly wage in GBP across regions of the United Kingdom.

<div class="work" id="mychange3">
  We observe a similar rank to that of house prices. London is where hourly wages are at their highest. However, since they are 
  directly proportional to the house price, highest hourly wage does not necessarily indicate a better standard of living.

<div class="paraclass" id="mychange7">
    We observe that people in the age group of 25-50 earn well above the minimum wage of about 8.5 GBP per hour. This could mean that 25-50 is the age for earning.
    Earning seems to be the lowest particularly among those aged 18 and lower which makes sense considering it is a first step into the corporate world. 20-25 and 50-60+
    is also where salaries seem to decline as the latter is when one is learning the job whereas the former is probably when one cannot be as productive as their younger 
    counterparts.

   Let us now look at average disposable income for the countries in the UK. We are only considering
   monthly mortgage and energy bills as part of monthly expenditure in this case.

    Despite having over 500 GBP disposable income, considering food expenses and other unprecendented expenses, 
    people are much likely to face shortfall each month, with rising inflation. People live paycheck to paycheck.
    The cost of living crisis was exacerbated as a result of COVID-19. Surviving amidst the chaos is a challenge
    people are still trying to overcome.
